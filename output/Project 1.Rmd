## Description of the data

HappyDB is a corpus of 100,000+ crowd-sourced happy moments. The data is collected from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk.) over 3 months.

Here are the instructions of the data collection task.

```
What made you happy today?  Reflect on the past {24 hours|3 months}, and recall three actual events 
that happened to you that made you happy.  Write down your happy moment in a complete sentence.
Write three such moments.

Examples of happy moments we are NOT looking for (e.g events in distant past, partial sentence):
    - The day I married my spouse
    - My Dog
```
